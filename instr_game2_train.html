    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">You are assigned to a first-response task after a disaster occurred with a robot teammate.</p>
    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">You have access to the floor plan BEFORE the disaster but it may have changed due to damage incurred by the disaster.
        For example, some paths may be blocked and only your robot teammate that is working on the scene can sense these
        changes. So be aware. </p>
    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> In this scenario, your task is to team up with a remote robot that is working on the disaster scene. The team goal is
        to search all the marked locations AS FAST AS POSSIBLE and your role is to help the robot by providing high-level
        guidance about what the next marked location to visit. </p>
    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> To provide your high-level guidance to the robot, click on a room marked with
        <img src="marked2.jpg" height = "25" width = "25"> that is unvisited. This informs the robot that is the next room that you think it should visit. </p>

    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> After each move, the system asks you a question regarding to action the robot just performed: </p>

<ul>
    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> <li>If you answer positive, you can change the robot's target. Then the robot will move towards the new target.
        The system continues asking you questions until the robot visits all of the marked locations. </li></p>  
    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> <li>You can change your command if you think that the robot is not performing the appropriate action. </li></p>
</ul>

    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> Your team performance will be measured in virtue of time and how efficient you give your preference the robot to move.
        If you give high level order to the robot, it will move 10% faster than its normal speed. </p>
